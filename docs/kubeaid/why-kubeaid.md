## The Problem KubeAid Solves

An operations team, typically has 2 hugely important tasks:

1. Developing a setup that enables as high availability for the companies applications as possible.
   This is a very difficult task, and it constantly evolves, as the software used in the setup, evolves.

2. Increasing the velocity of the application teams, by assisting them with improving how their application operates in production.

Even with Kubernetes, there is a lot of work to be done, to pick the right solutions for each feature you need - and it is our experience that 95% of what one team needs, is the EXACT same most of the other teams need.

**KubeAid** aims to be a constantly evolving solution for 1. - enabling the collaboration of operations teams across the
world, to increase the velocity of every operations team, so they can focus on 2. - while everyone gets to enjoy a
highly available and secure operations setup.

Quite often its very difficult to find enough who can to do this work, and especially since EVERY other company, is
building a replica of what you are building to solve 1. This is even WHY Kubernetes was started, to help enable
collaboration between companies on a shared goal.

**KubeAid** is being developed by [Obmondo.com](https://obmondo.com) - where we build the solutions our customers need, and
share the work with everyone, via this project. We feel this is the only way, We ever have a chance of actually
delivering the features that every operations team should have - without needing to have a subject matter expert at hand
for everything.

The fact that we help many customers operate their k8s clusters, also enables us to hire more k8s experts than is
normally available - and we can offer them a job where they get time to work on the challenges that interest them, to a
much higher degree - because we focus on one thing - furthering this project and delivering value to the customers that
sponsor it, via their subscriptions and development tasks they ask of us.

[Obmondo.com](https://obmondo.com) offers low cost subscriptions, where we monitor your clusters and handle your alerts
24/7/365 - enabling teams to not have to worry about who is on vacation, or sick - as we are there to back them up if
they need it.
