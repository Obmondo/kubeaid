# Host your own central registry with KubeAid


Harbor is an open-source container registry that serves as a robust alternative to paid offerings like DockerHub Business, AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and others. 
It provides a secure, scalable, and feature-rich solution for hosting container images on-premises, giving you full control over your data without storage or access limits.

At Obmondo, we rely on Harbor as the central registry for all our build artifacts, container images, and CI/CD operations. 
Hosting our own registry enhances security, improves performance, and reduces reliance on third-party services.

If you're new to KubeAid, check out our [README](../README.md) and our [setup guide](setup-guide.md) to get started.


## Deploying Harbor with KubeAid

- `argocd-apps/templates/harbor.yaml`: This is a template for ArgoCD application. Click [here](../argocd-helm-charts/harbor/example/argocd-apps/templates/harbor.yaml)
- `argocd-apps/values-harbor.yaml`: This file lets you customize Harbor template file using values. Click [here](../argocd-helm-charts/harbor/example/argocd-apps/values-harbor.yaml)

Deployment Steps:
1. Modify the Harbor template to fit your environment (e.g., sources, destinations, etc.).
2. Update the values file with your specific configurations.

## CI/CD with Harbor and KubeAid

At Obmondo, we integrate Harbor into our CI/CD pipelines using Gitea runner. Here's a sample workflow:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-pull-request:
  runs-on: [server-name]
  needs: [ci]
  uses: []
  with:
    push: true
    file: ./Dockerfile
    tags: harbor.example.com/organization/project-name:${{ gitea.event.number }}
  secrets:
    username: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_PASSWORD }}
    
  some-other-action:
    runs-on: [server-name]
    container:
      image: harbor.organization.com/organization/project-name:version
```
