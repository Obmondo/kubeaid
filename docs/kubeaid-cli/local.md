# Local Provider

The `local` provider is used to provision a KubeAid managed `K3D` cluster in your local machine.
> We don't support cluster upgrades and disaster recovery for the `local` provider.

## Prerequisites

- Fork the [KubeAid Config](https://github.com/Obmondo/kubeaid-config) repository.

- Keep your Git provider credentials ready.
  > For GitHub, you can create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token), which has the permission to write to your KubeAid Config fork.
  > That PAT will be used as the password.

- Have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running locally.

## Installation

```bash
KUBEAID_CLI_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/Obmondo/kubeaid-cli/releases/latest" | jq -r .tag_name)
OS=$([ "$(uname -s)" = "Linux" ] && echo "linux" || echo "darwin")
CPU_ARCHITECTURE=$([ "$(uname -m)" = "x86_64" ] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64")

wget "https://github.com/Obmondo/kubeaid-cli/releases/download/${KUBEAID_CLI_VERSION}/kubeaid-cli-${KUBEAID_CLI_VERSION}-${OS}-${CPU_ARCHITECTURE}"
sudo mv kubeaid-cli-${KUBEAID_CLI_VERSION}-${OS}-${CPU_ARCHITECTURE} /usr/local/bin/kubeaid-cli
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubeaid-cli
```

## Preparing the Configuration Files

You need to have 2 configuration files : `general.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` containing required credentials.

Run :
```shell script
kubeaid-cli config generate local
```
and a sample of those 2 configuration files will be generated in `outputs/configs`.

Edit those 2 configuration files, based on your requirements.

## Bootstrapping the Cluster

Run the following command, to bootstrap the cluster :
```shell script
kubeaid-cli cluster bootstrap
```

Aside from the logs getting streamed to your standard output, they'll be saved in `outputs/.log`.

Once the cluster gets bootstrapped, its kubeconfig gets saved in `outputs/kubeconfigs/clusters/main.yaml`.

You can access the cluster, by running :
```shell script
export KUBECONFIG=./outputs/kubeconfigs/main.yaml
kubectl cluster-info
```
Go ahead and explore it by accessing the [ArgoCD]() and [Grafana]() dashboards.

## Deleting the Cluster

You can delete the cluster, by running :
```shell script
kubeaid-cli cluster delete management
```
