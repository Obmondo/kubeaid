  {{/* While developers can securely store the secrets in Azure Key Vault, services need a way to
       access Azure Key Vault. Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in
       Microsoft Entra ID for applications to use when connecting to resources that support
       Microsoft Entra authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Microsoft
       Entra tokens without having to manage any credentials.
       There are two types of managed identities :
       
       (1) System Assigned
       
       (2) User Assigned - You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or
                           more Azure Resources.
