# We disabling the updates for openobserve, since there's no upstream
# support for dex OIDC connector configurations for enterprise.
# It expects all the configurations to be passed as configmap, but passing
# secrets/credentials like that doesn't seem a good approach.
#
# In our case, we wanted to provide OIDC client secret via Sealed Secrets,
# but as of now, we have to draft enterprise .Values.enterprise.dex.config
# in secrets and then mount the same as file.
#
# In upstream @kayahk drafted a PR which solves a similar problem.
